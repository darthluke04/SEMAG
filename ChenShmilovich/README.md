**Same functionality with better and more readable code.**

Hello everyone!<br><br>
The presented code is my first shot at building a javascript game.<br>
It is a classic 8-ball pool game.
You can choose to play against a friend, or against an AI, with various difficulty levels.

Have fun, and good luck!
