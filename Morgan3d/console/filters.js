/* "1 euro filter"

   Tuning:
   - Decreasing the `minimumCutoff` [frequency] will decrease jitter.
   - Increasing the `speed` will decrease lag.
   
   Start with speed = 0 and adjust minCutoff until results are good
   for slowly-changing values. Then change the values quickly and
   increase speed until the lag is minimal (while still preserving
   jitter filtering).
