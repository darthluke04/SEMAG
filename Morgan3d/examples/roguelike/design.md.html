                **Design**

Cell
: Holds objects

Entity
: First-class object in the world.

AirEffect
: Effect applied in the air


Map Layers
=======================================================

*AirEffect*
: Environmental effects that appear over everything else.
  e.g., fog
  
*HighEntity*
: The main layer. Contains all entitys.

*MidEntity*
: The main layer. Contains all entitys.

*LowEntity*
: The main layer. Contains all entitys.

*GroundEffect*
: Environmental effects applied to the cell that appear underneath all mains.
  e.g., wet, bloody, icy

*FloorEntity*
: Drawn on top of the ground and underneath everything else, but not immutable.
  e.g., stairs, bridges, ladders

*Ground*
: Immutable terrain property of the cell. e.g., stream, gravel, lava, grass.
 
 
Entity Properties
=======================================================

`map_layer`
: Which general z-layer the object appears in: `"FloorEntity"`, 
  `"LowEntity"`, `"MidEntity"`, `"HighEntity"`.  

`fills_cell`
: True for objects that are exclusive in a cell. Most
  characters, all walls, etc. You cannot pass this
  object without changing or destroying it.

`size`
: For purposes of fitting one thing inside of another

`weight`
: Weight for carrying purposes

`uproot_force`
: Extra effort required to remove this object before it can be
  moved or carried.
  
`move_force`
: Force required to push this object

`health`
: How much damage this can take before destroyed.

`destroy_into`
: What this object is replaced with when destroyed.
  Extra damage is applied to the new objects, and
  any effects are applied to them as well.

`burning`
: True if on fire (renders with a fire overlay)

`poisoned`
: True if poisoned

`sensitivity`
: Table mapping damage types to modifiers. E.g.,
  `sensitivity.heat = 100%` means normal sensitivity
  to heat damage, `0%` = immune, `200%` = takes
  double damage, `50%` = partly resistant. Unspecified
  defaults to `100%`. The net damage taken is the product
  of all multipliers.
