A 1-4 player competitive territory-building game played on a hex map, created for [OST Jam](https://itch.io/jam/ost-jam), featuring music by [Calamity Range](https://calamityrangemusic.bandcamp.com). It was built using [@morgan3d](https://github.com/morgan3d)'s [quadplayâœœ](https://github.com/morgan3d/quadplay) virtual console, and should be playable on any device with a reasonably modern web browser.
